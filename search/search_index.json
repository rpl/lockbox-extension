            "text": "What\u2019s the difference between Lockbox and the Firefox password manager?\n\n\nFirefox password manager is the built-in feature that saves and autofills website login information. You can protect these logins with a master password. \n\n\nLockbox is a stand-alone password manager extension that you can secure with a Firefox Account for newer encryption than what is offered with password manager. \n\n\nThe alpha version of Lockbox lets you create, store and manage entries (a site\u2019s username and password) and copy and paste login information. We realize managing passwords this way may feel very manual, but we plan to add features like autofill and password generation in future releases. We are also working to build cloud backup, create a mobile app, and support multiple browsers.\n\n\nCan I use Lockbox and the Firefox password manager at the same time?\n\n\nNo. When you install Lockbox, Firefox automatically disables the password manager. If you disable or delete Lockbox, Firefox re-enables password manager on the browser\u2019s next restart.\n\n\nIf I disable or delete Lockbox, will login information from my entries transfer into the password manager?\n\n\nNo. But login information you previously added to password manager will still be available.\n\n\nDoes Lockbox import my information from password manager?\n\n\nNot in the current alpha version.\n\n\nWhat security technology does Lockbox use?\n\n\nWhen you protect Lockbox with a Firefox Account, Lockbox uses \nAES256-GCM\n encryption, a tamper-resistent block cipher technology, to protect your data. Lockbox also uses \nHMAC SHA-256\n to \u201chash\u201d searchable data for additional security. \n\n\nHow do I disable or delete Lockbox?\n\n\n\n\nClick the menu button \n\n and choose Add-ons \n\n\n or \n Lockbox\n\n\n\n\nIf I delete Lockbox, what happens to the entries I\u2019ve saved?\n\n\nThe alpha version of Lockbox doesn\u2019t offer backup or synchronization. You\u2019ll need to re-add login information to Lockbox after installing it again.\n\n\nWhat if I forget my Firefox Account password?\n\n\nFirefox Accounts do not offer password recovery functionality. If you added a Firefox Account to Lockbox and forget your password, you\u2019ll need to reset your Firefox Account. Note that you\u2019ll lose all saved Lockbox entries.\n\n\nWill Lockbox work with other password managers?\n\n\nThe alpha version of Lockbox hasn\u2019t been tested widely with other password managers. We recommend disabling or deleting other password managers from Firefox before installing Lockbox.\n\n\nDo Lockbox entries sync to other computers with Lockbox installed?\n\n\nYes, if you secure Lockbox with a Firefox Account.\n\n\nCan I try Lockbox if I don\u2019t have a Mozilla.com email address?\n\n\nSure. To get started, click the \nInstall Lockbox\n button on the Introduction page. Note that this is an alpha version. Features and functionality will change as we continue developing Lockbox.\n\n\nIf I already have a Firefox Account, can I create a separate Firefox Account to use only with Lockbox?\n\n\nYou can create a new account using a different email address than the one you use for your existing Firefox Account. Note that the new Firefox Account won\u2019t sync bookmarks, history and open tabs unless you use it to sign into the browser.",

It documents all events currently collected through telemetry, as well those planned for collection but not currently implemented. It will be updated to reflect all new and planned data collection.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\nData collection is done solely for the purpose of product development, improvement and maintenance. We are particularly interested in data that will help us answer the following questions.\n\n\n\n\nDo people Save Passwords in Lockbox?\n\n\nHow many? (measured by count of items saved per user)\n\n\nHow often? (number of credentials saved per user per time interval)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo people create their own passwords or use Lockbox to generate them?\n\n\nRatio: (Number of times the PW generator is used when storing an item) / (number of credentials stored)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo people use the passwords they store on Lockbox?\n\n\nHow many times (per some unit of time) do stored credentials get auto-filled or copied to the clipboard?\n\n\nHow many times do users click to reveal a password?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow well does does auto-filling credentials work \n(not in alpha)\n?\n\n\nWhen credentials are auto-filled, are they filled into the correct fields?\n\n\nHow often must the user make a change to what fields were filled?\n\n\nHow to measure these things??? is there an easier way than just asking if the auto-fill didn't work?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo people continue to use Lockbox after first use?\n\n\nOut of those who install, how many use it more than once?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere are the drop-off points in the user flow?\n\n\nDo the majority of people make it all the way through the setup process?\n\n\nOnce initially setup, do people continue to add credentials?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are people's opinions on LB\n\n\nFeedback forms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo people sync their passwords \n(not in alpha)\n?\n\n\nHow does syncing affect engagement?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat type of sites do people use Lockbox with?\n\n\nDo they use Lockbox only for their most sensitive accounts?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollection\n\n\nNote:\n \nThis is the collection plan for our internal alpha release. For our beta release will be taking advantage of test pilot's telemetry API. The metrics plan for beta will be described in a separate document.\n\n\nAt this point, all measurements related to Lockbox will be made client-side. However, future releases will give users the option to sync their Lockbox data via an FxA account, at which point additional measurements will be logged server-side through the FxA data pipeline. We are not directly responsible for the measurements made through that mechanism.\n\n\nFor our internal alpha release, we will be making use of the public JavaScript API that allows recording and sending of event data through an add-on. \nThis means that for our alpha release we will only be collecting event-based data\n. The API is documented here:\n\n\nhttps://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/collection/events.html#the-api\n\n\nOnce the events are logged in the client they should appear in \nabout:telemetry\n. From there they will be submitted in the main ping payload under \nprocesses.dynamic.events\n and available through the usual services (STMO and ATMO), as well as amplitude.\n\n\nEvent Registration and Recording\n\n\nThe events that we will record will conform to the structure expected by the telemetry pipeline. When the events are logged in telemetry they will be a list of:\n\n\n[timestamp, category, method, object, value, extra]\n\n\nThe API takes care of the timestamp for us. We just need to define \ncategory\n, \nmethod\n, \nobject\n and \nextra\n (\nvalue\n is optional and we won't use it).\n\n\nBecause we are using the API through an add-on it \nisn't\n necessary that we include an events.yaml file.\n\n\nInstead we will define our events by \nregistering\n them using a call to \nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(category, eventData)\n.\n\n\nHere's a breakdown of how a to register a typical event:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.registerEvents(\nevent_category\n, {\n    \nevent_name\n: {\n        methods: [\nclick\n, ... ], // types of events that can occur\n        objects: [\na_button\n, ... ], // objects event can occur on\n        extra: {\nkey\n: \nvalue\n, ... } // key-value pairs (strings)\n    }\n\n\n\n\nFor our purposes, we will use the \nextra\n field for a few purposes:\n\n\n\n\nTo log the FxA user id of the client logging the event (e.g. \n\"fxauid\": uid\n)\n\n\nTo log the UUID of the item that has been added or changed (e.g. \n\"item_id\": UUID\n)\n\n\nTo log the fields that are modified when an item is updated in the datastore (e.g. \n\"fields\": \"password,notes\"\n  (because the value has to be a string we will have to concat the fields that were updated somehow)\n\n\n\n\nOnce an event is registered, we can record it with:\n\n\nServices.telemetry.recordEvent(category, method, object, null, extra)\n\n\nWhen recording, we can use \nnull\n for \nvalue\n.\n\n\nSee the Events section for specific examples of event registration and recording.\n\n\nMetrics Overview\n\n\n(this section may redundant with analysis section)\nFor alpha, we'd like to (ideally) like to be able to track the following general categories of things:\n\n\n\n\nThe setup flow, so we can know at what points (if any) people quit the flow before finishing it\n\n\nTop-level interactions centered around use of the Lockbox toolbar icon. This includes interactions within the initial doorhanger that is displayed when the user clicks the icon.\n\n\nInteractions with the list of the user's Lockbox items (credentials)\n\n\nInteractions with the add / modify dialogs used to enter / edit item information\n\n\nChanges to the datastore that actually contains the user's items, in addition to user actions that lead to those changes\n\n\nWhen the user submits feedback about Lockbox\n\n\nUsage of the copy and reveal functions for stored Lockbox items.\n\n\n\n\nEach of these are described below within their own Events subsection.\n\n\nNon-Event Metrics\n\n\nThese are the metrics we plan to collect regarding the state of user datastores. Note that we won't be able to record these directly for alpha. We will have to infer them from the event data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn_items\n The number of credentials that exist in the user's datastore. Integer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn_notes\n The number of items for which the user has manually entered custom notes for. Integer\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp_last\n The timestamp of the last edit the user made to the datastore. Does not necessarily correspond to the last time they opened the CRUD editor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nn_uses\n The number of times a user copied or auto-filled a Lockbox item.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Events Currently Recorded\n\n\nAll events are currently implemented under the \ncategory: lockboxV0\n. The \nextra\n field always contains \nfxauid\n where possible (i.e. after FxA auth). For events pertaining to a particular Lockbox item, \nitemid\n is also included. They are listed and grouped together based on the contents of the event's \nmethod\n field.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstartup\n fires when the webextension is loaded. \nobjects\n: webextension. Note that this event fires whenever the browser is started, so is not indicative of direct user interaction with Lockbox.\n\n\n\n\n\n\niconClick\n fires when someone clicks the toolbar icon. \nobjects\n: toolbar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrender\n events fire when the firstrun view (showing the initial Lockbox setup form), item manager or doorhanger (when implemented) are rendered. \nobjects\n: firstrun, manage, doorhanger\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitemAdding\n, \nitemUpdating\n, \nitemDeleting\n fire when a user clicks to submit a new item or edit or delete an existing item. \nobjects\n: addItemForm, updatingItemForm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitemAdded\n, \nitemUpdated\n, \nitemDeleted\n fire after a successful add/update/delete action. \nobjects\n: addItemForm, updatingItemForm\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadded\n, \nupdated\n, \ndeleted\n fire when an item is added/updated/deleted in the backend datastore. Has itemid in the extra field. \nobjects\n: datastore\n\n\n\n\n\n\nitemSelected\n fires when a user clicks an item in the itemlist. \nobjects\n itemList  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nusernameCopied\n and \npasswordCopied\n fire when a user copies their username or password from an item. \nobjects\n: itemDetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfeedbackClick\n fires when the user clicks the \"Send Feedback\" button. \nobjects\n: manage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfaqClick\n fires when the user clicks the \"FAQ\" button. \nobjects\n: manage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresetRequested\n fires when the user clicks the \"Reset\" button in the Lockbox settings. \nobjects\n: settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresetCompleted\n fires when the user completes a reset of their Lockbox data in the Lockbox settings. \nobjects\n: settings\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Planned Events\n\n\nThese events will be implemented once the corresponding functionality is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfxaSignIn\n fires when someone clicks the signin button during firstrun. \nobjects\n: fxaSignInPage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconfirmPW\n fires when the user clicks the button to confirm their FxA pw. \nobjects\n: confirmPWButton\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndoorhangerItemSelected\n fires when a user clicks an item in the doorhanger's itemlist. \nobjects\n doorhanger  \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndoorhangerItemCopied\n fires when a user copies an item's username/password from the doorhanger's entry view. \nobjects\n doorhangerEntryDetails.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\ndoorhangerAddClick\n fires when the user clicks to add a new entry from the doorhanger. \nobjects\n doorhanger  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nDocs for the Public JS API that allows us to log events thru an add-on:\n\n\nhttps://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/collection/events.html#the-api",

The metrics plan for beta will be described in a separate document.  At this point, all measurements related to Lockbox will be made client-side. However, future releases will give users the option to sync their Lockbox data via an FxA account, at which point additional measurements will be logged server-side through the FxA data pipeline. We are not directly responsible for the measurements made through that mechanism.  For our internal alpha release, we will be making use of the public JavaScript API that allows recording and sending of event data through an add-on.  This means that for our alpha release we will only be collecting event-based data . The API is documented here:  https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/telemetry/collection/events.html#the-api  Once the events are logged in the client they should appear in  about:telemetry . From there they will be submitted in the main ping payload under  processes.dynamic.events  and available through the usual services (STMO and ATMO), as well as amplitude.",

When the events are logged in telemetry they will be a list of:  [timestamp, category, method, object, value, extra]  The API takes care of the timestamp for us. We just need to define  category ,  method ,  object  and  extra  ( value  is optional and we won't use it).  Because we are using the API through an add-on it  isn't  necessary that we include an events.yaml file.  Instead we will define our events by  registering  them using a call to  Services.telemetry.registerEvents(category, eventData) .  Here's a breakdown of how a to register a typical event:  Services.telemetry.registerEvents( event_category , {\n     event_name : {\n        methods: [ click , ... ], // types of events that can occur\n        objects: [ a_button , ... ], // objects event can occur on\n        extra: { key :  value , ... } // key-value pairs (strings)\n    }  For our purposes, we will use the  extra  field for a few purposes:   To log the FxA user id of the client logging the event (e.g.  \"fxauid\": uid )  To log the UUID of the item that has been added or changed (e.g.  \"item_id\": UUID )  To log the fields that are modified when an item is updated in the datastore (e.g.  \"fields\": \"password,notes\"   (because the value has to be a string we will have to concat the fields that were updated somehow)   Once an event is registered, we can record it with:  Services.telemetry.recordEvent(category, method, object, null, extra)  When recording, we can use  null  for  value .  See the Events section for specific examples of event registration and recording.",
